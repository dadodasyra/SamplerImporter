<h2>Sample Importer</h2>

<p>This App Script (that can be modified inside 'Extensions > App Script') receives every new *.txt* result file
    detected by your
    local <a href="">watcher</em> Powershell script and appends one row in the
        <strong>Released Samples</strong> (configurable) sheet.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The watcher POSTs <code>{filename, content (base64), token}</code>
        to the Web-App URL that has been deployed from the Apps Script UI.
        Along with the POSTs body a google access token needs to be provided due to Roche account coniguration. See next
        paragraph for more.</li>
    <li>The Web-App authenticates the token, checks the filename hasnâ€™t been
        processed before, parses the text and writes the row.</li>
    <li>Processed filenames are kept as a JSON array in
        <em>Script Properties</em> so re-uploads are ignored.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Google access token, how to ?</h3>
<p>The watcher script includes an access token from a roche.com g-account.<br>
    Ideally we would prefer using a service account but this would mean that IT should give access to one using GCP.

    So by alternative we use GoogleCloud Cli, install it with a powershell:
    <code>
        (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe', "$env:TEMP\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe")
        & "$env:TEMP\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe" /noreporting /quiet /singleuser
    </code>
    The watcher script will then be able to fetch token using gcloud CLI.

    Given that Roche is making users change their password every year~ it may be mean that the token could be revoked.<br>
    So the watcher script will try to reauthent using auth login if any issue occurs with gcloud.
