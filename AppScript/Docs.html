<h2>Sample Importer</h2>
<h3>Basic client installation</h3>
<p>
    Install GCloud CLI either from <a href="https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe">the installer</a> or using the powershell commands in "Google access token how to ?" part.
    <br>Then download the <a href="https://github.com/dadodasyra/SamplerImporter/blob/main/SampleWatcher.ps1">local watcher script</a> along with the <a href="https://github.com/dadodasyra/SamplerImporter/blob/main/SampleWatcher.vbs">launcher script</a>.<br>
    <br>- The watcher (ps1 file) should stay in your <code>%USERPROFILE%\SampleWatcher</code> folder (so if your username is "dadodasyra" then the watcher should be in <code>C:\Users\dadodasyra\SampleWatcher</code>).
    <br>- The launcher (vbs file) should be placed in your <code>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</code> folder so it will be launched at every Windows startup. (You can also access this folder with Win+R and typing <code>shell:startup</code>).
    <br>Configure the watcher script by editing the <code>SampleWatcher.ps1</code> file, with the folder to sync and the app script URL (<a href="https://github.com/dadodasyra/SamplerImporter?tab=readme-ov-file#2----server-side-components-bound-to-the-google-sheet">see github doc</a>), etc...
    <br><br>For the first time run the launcher (vbs file), then follow the first sign in process.
    <br>You're done !
</p>
<h2>Developer doc</h2>
<p>This App Script (that can be modified inside 'Extensions > App Script') receives every new *.txt* result file
    detected by your
    local <a href="https://github.com/dadodasyra/SamplerImporter/blob/main/SampleWatcher.ps1">watcher</a> Powershell script and appends one row in the
    <strong>Released Samples</strong> (configurable) sheet.<br>
    Better documentation available in the <a href="https://github.com/dadodasyra/SamplerImporter/">README on github</a>.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The watcher POSTs <code>{filename, content (base64), token}</code>
        to the Web-App URL that has been deployed from the Apps Script UI.
        Along with the POSTs body a google access token needs to be provided due to Roche account coniguration. See next
        paragraph for more.
    </li>
    <li>The Web-App authenticates the token, checks the filename hasnâ€™t been
        processed before, parses the text and writes the row.
    </li>
    <li>Processed filenames are kept as a JSON array in
        <em>Script Properties</em> so re-uploads are ignored.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Google access token, how to ?</h3>
<p>The watcher script includes an access token from a roche.com g-account.<br>
    Ideally we would prefer using a service account but this would mean that IT should give access to one using GCP.

    So by alternative we use GoogleCloud Cli, install it with a powershell:
    <code>
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe', "$env:TEMP\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe")
& "$env:TEMP\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe" /noreporting /quiet /singleuser
    </code>
    The watcher script will then be able to fetch token using gcloud CLI.

    Given that Roche is making users change their password every year~ it may be mean that the token could be
    revoked.<br>
    So the watcher script will try to reauthent using auth login if any issue occurs with gcloud.
